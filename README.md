# Phaser Discord Games Template

This Project Template is a great starting point for creating games on Discord with Phaser, utilising their new Embedded App SDK. It helps you seamlessly integrate custom games and activities into your Discord server, fostering community engagement, interaction, and fun.

We have a [comprehensive tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/creating-discord-games-with-phaser) you can read on the Phaser site, which includes the steps required to create a Discord App and get your Phaser game running as an activity within it.

Please work through our tutorial, as it was written to go with this template repository to get you up and running fast.

## Template Project Structure

We have provided a default project structure to get you started. This is as follows:

- `client` - Contains the game & Discord SDK source code.
- `client/main.js` - The main entry point for the client. This contains the game & Discord SDK configuration which starts the game.
- `client/scenes/` - The Phaser Scenes are in this folder.
- `client/assets/` - Contains game assets(sprites, sounds, spritesheets, etc).
- `server/server.js` - Contains Discord SDK for OAuth2 connection

## Handling Assets

Vite supports loading assets via JavaScript module `import` statements.

This template provides support for both embedding assets and also loading them from a static folder. To embed an asset, you can import it at the top of the JavaScript file you are using it in:

```js
import logoImg from './assets/logo.png'
```

To load static files such as audio files, videos, etc place them into the `client/assets` folder. Then you can use this path in the Loader calls within Phaser:

```js
preload ()
{
    //  This is an example of an imported bundled image.
    //  Remember to import it at the top of this file
    this.load.image('logo', logoImg);

    //  This is an example of loading a static image
    //  from the public/assets folder:
    this.load.image('background', 'assets/bg.png');
}
```

When you issue the `npm run build` command, all static assets are automatically copied to the `dist/assets` folder.

## Customizing the Template

### Vite

If you want to customize your build, such as adding plugin (i.e. for loading CSS or fonts), you can modify the `client/vite.config.js` file for cross-project changes, or you can modify and/or create new configuration files and target them in specific npm tasks inside of `package.json`. Please see the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) for more information.
